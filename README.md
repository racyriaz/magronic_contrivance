# this program requires:
1) arduino NANO / Uno
2) Magronic contrivance's complete hardware machinery
3) basic knowledge on agricultre / farming 
4) temperature sensor(lm35)
5) moisture sendor
6) ph sensor

# what this code does:
1) creates artificial envirnoment
2) agitates complete machinery with 2 HP motors
3) regulate 3 vital parameters using the provided sensors

# About us:
This project deals with organic manure production. In conventionl way of organic manure production, it takes about 
2 to 3 week to produce organic manure in the tropical region.

So our(Magronic Contrivance Pvt LTd.) motto was to stipulate time factor with help of artifical environment.
Provided with same inputs to the machine which we developed at IIMB(NSRCEL)
